Since [Vintage Story](https://www.vintagestory.at) is an in-development sandbox indie game with a wide scope, there's tons of stuff in it that doesn't work very well. Either due to an oversight, unimplemented feature, conscious balancing decision, or a combination of all three+, there are many things that I'd like to see fixed in VS. This is an attempt to catalogue them (or up to when I get bored of writing l o l).

## Sticks
Sticks are an essential resource in the early and mid-game, but they're very frustrating to gather whether you have shears or not.

### Early Game
Sticks are either very dangerous or very boring to collect despite being needed in large quantities for firing pottery. You either run through forests (bears → bad idea) and grab dropped ones, or hold LMB for about 3 minutes per stack in a shrubland, which is mind-numbingly boring.

### Mid Game
Pretending trees are wooly sheep and shearing them in their entirety before felling them (maybe don't fell sheep) is just stupid, finicky, and not fun.

### Solution
Chopping trees is more fun than killing shrubs and shaving trees. Add a time-intensive manual method of turning logs into sticks, and consider making the pit kiln not require them.

## Pottery Firing
Pit kilns are fine early-game, but because of the aforementioned reasons (and a few more), they're very annoying to use in the mid-game, nor does it make sense that you have to stick to literal hole-in-ground infrastructure technology to make pottery before you reach the late iron age and have the menagerie of resources to make a beehive kiln.

### Solution
Add a mid-game kiln a la the bloomery (but reusable) that requires only one fuel type and is accessible in the bronze age.
